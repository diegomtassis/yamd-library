# Yet another MegaDrive / Genesis library


Sega Mega Drive / Genesis utility library written by diegomtassis as an extension to SGDK.

It's currently, and will always be, work in progress.

Utilities here have been created at some point in time as support for some game development, and they are generic enough to be extracted to a multipurpose library.

Feel free to use whatever you need for your game.

#### Utilities

Code is located under the fwk folder. As of now there are utilities covering more or less deeply the following concerns:
* 2D simple physics
* Lists
* Display writer emulating a typewriting machine
* Countdown


#### To be implemented
* Spacial grid handling


#### Test suite

This project includes a test suite which can be compiled into a rom and executed either in real hardware or an emulator. The suite offers several executable scenarios which test the utilities under different circumstances, but serve as well as examples showcasing how to use the library.


#### SGDK

SGDK is a development kit for Sega Mega Drive created by Stephane Dallongeville
