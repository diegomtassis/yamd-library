# Yet another MegaDrive/Genesis library


Sega Mega Drive / Genesis utility library written by diegomtassis as an extension to SGDK.

It's currently, and will always be, work in progress.

Utilities here I created at some point in time as support for some game, and they are generic enough to be extracted to a multipurpose library.

Feel free to use whatever you need for your game.

#### Utilities

The utilities code is located under the fwk folder.
As of now there are utilities covering more or less deeply the following concerns:
* 2D simple physics
* Lists
* Display writer emulating a typewriting machine
* Countdown


#### To be implemented
* Spacial grid handling


#### Test suite

The project includes a test suite which can be compiled into a rom and executed either in real hardware or an emulator. The test suite offers several executable scenarios which test the different utilities.  


#### SGDK

SGDK is a development kit for Sega Mega Drive created by Stephane Dallongeville
