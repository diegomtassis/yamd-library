# Yet another MegaDrive/Genesis library

### The library


Sega Mega Drive / Genesis library written by diegomtassis as an extension to SGDK.

It's currently work in progress.

The utilities here are those which I needed to develop for other games and are generic enough to be extracted to a multipurpose library.

Copy whatever you need for you game and remove everythinbg else.
