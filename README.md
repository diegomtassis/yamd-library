# Yet another MegaDrive/Genesis library

### The library


Sega Mega Drive / Genesis utility library written by diegomtassis as an extension to SGDK.

It's currently, and will always be, work in progress.

Utilities here are those I created at some point in time as support for some game and ended up being generic enough to be extracted to a multipurpose library.

Feel free to use whatever you need for your game.
